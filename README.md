# latchproteinengineering

## Potential Project

> Use programs from paper on computational enzyme engineering pipelines on enzymes previously engineered for better substrate specificity (example: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27588038/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27588038/))
> Upload to Latch using SDK

## Protein engineering pipeline

1. Obtain enzyme structure (crystal structure)
2. Study catalytic mechanism (GROMACS/AMBER)
3. Build a substrate-enzyme complex (Rosetta - GALigandDock)
4. Identify design positions through conservation analysis (ConSurf)
5. Activity and specificity engineering (FuncLib)
6. Screening (Rosetta/flexddG)
